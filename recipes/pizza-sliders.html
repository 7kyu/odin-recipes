    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 12-count pkg. Hawaiian Sweet Rolls</li>
        <li>4 ounces Sliced Pepperoni</li>
        <li>6 slices Provolone Cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Garlic Butter:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>½ cup Butter</li>
        <li>3 Garlic Cloves, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Red Chili Flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Fresh Oregano, diced</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce (warmed)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9 x 13 baking pan or sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. This is an important step because the cheese will melt and can stick to the foil.</li>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter. Add the garlic, red chili flakes, and oregano. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Use a long serrated knife to slice the rolls in half, lengthwise, so you have a slab of rolls. Don't pull the rolls apart or individually slice them because you want the rolls to be completely connected. Place the bottom side of the rolls in the pan</li>
        <li>Brush ⅓ of the garlic butter on the bottom half of the roll. Layer with provolone cheese, pepperoni, and then sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Place the top half of the rolls on the top. Brush with remaining garlic butter, ensuring to cover the rolls.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake covered for about 20-22 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Uncover the foil and bake for 3 to 5 minutes longer. Cut into pieces and serve hot! Serve with a bowl of warmed marinara sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
